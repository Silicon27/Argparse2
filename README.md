# Argparse2

This is a simple wrapper around the `argparse` module that makes it easier to define command line arguments.

Additional features separate from the traditional argparse syntax include:
- **Flag operators**, improving accessibility to an arguments' info.
- **Target functions**, allowing for custom functions to be called when a flag is used.
